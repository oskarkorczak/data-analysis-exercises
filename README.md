# Machine Learning Explorations
This repository documents my exploration across ML/AI Python libraries. Mainly it focues on familiarising with various, handy libraries, its usage and capabilities. 

## Jupyter Notebooks
I use [Google Colab][colab] as online IDE for Jypyter notebooks. It allows for installing Python libs, writing code, running it, saving and importing/exporting Jupyter notebooks. All supported by Google Cloud behind the scenes. It only requires Google account. 

## GitHub notebook rendering issues
In case of GitHub having rendering issues (see below), try coping the GitHub notebook URL and pasting it to the [online Jupyter viewer][online-jupyter-viewer]:

```
Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?
