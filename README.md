# Data Analysis Exercises
This repository documents my exploration across data analysis (incl. ML/AI) using Python libraries. Mainly it focues on familiarising with various analysis techniques applied in practice, handy libraries, its usage and capabilities. 

## Jupyter Notebooks
I use [Google Colab][colab] as online IDE for Jypyter notebooks. It allows for installing Python libs, writing code, running it, saving and importing/exporting Jupyter notebooks. All supported by Google Cloud behind the scenes. It requires Google account to operate. 

## GitHub notebook rendering issues
In case of GitHub repository preview having rendering issues (see below), try coping the GitHub notebook URL and pasting it to the [online Jupyter viewer][online-jupyter-viewer]:

```
Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?
